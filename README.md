# CS50's Introduction to Computer Science

Exercises and projects from the [Harvard University course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/).
<br/> 
  
"This course is an intensive introduction to the intellectual enterprises of `computer science` and the art of `programming`. It is a fast-moving course that demands a substantial commitment of time and effort for students to be successful. It teaches students how to `think algorithmically` and `solve problems efficiently`. Problem sets are inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming."
